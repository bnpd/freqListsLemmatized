Frequency lists for different languages, lemmatized.

The lists are available under the [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. They are based on [Hermit Dave's frequency lists](https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords) and have been lemmatized using the [SpaCy lemmatizer](https://spacy.io/api/lemmatizer/).

The files have only minimally been filtered be me and therefore contain offensive words, non-dictionary words, typos, abbreviations and slang. The lemmatizations also have inaccuracies.
